# Sewer Flow Analytical QA Framework

> An automated, reproducible QA framework for sewer flow survey data, developed as part of my MSc Dissertation.

## 🔬 Methodology: Design Science (DSM)
This project adopts a **Design Science Methodology (DSM)** to prioritises **auditability, reproducibility, and transparency** in engineering processes.

## 🛠️ Core Features
- **Industry-Standard Parsing**: Support for FDV and Rainfall (.R) formats.
- **Multi-Level QA**: Completeness, dropout detection, diurnal flatness, and hydraulic coherence.
- **System Diagnostics**: Upstream-downstream volume balance analysis.
- **Hydrological Ingestion**: WaPUG/UDG compliant storm segmentation.

## 🧪 Experiments Conducted
The tool was validated using the Swansea dataset across 5 core experiments:
1. Missingness & Completeness
2. Upstream-Downstream Balance
3. RAG Health Classification
4. Dropout Detection
5. Rainfall Storm Segmentation
