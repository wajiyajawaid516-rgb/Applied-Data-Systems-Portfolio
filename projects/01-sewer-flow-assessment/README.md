# Sewer Flow Assessment Tool (Collaboration with Arup)

## 📌 Dissertation Overview
**Grade: Distinction | MSc Data Science and Analytics (Cardiff University)**

Developed in collaboration with **Arup**, this project addressed the critical challenge of validating high-volume, complex sewer record data. The tool focused on **Time-Series Anomaly Detection** to ensure hydraulic models are built on clean, reliable data.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Data Volume:** 1,000+ complex hydraulic sewer records.
- **Language:** Python (Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib).
- **Techniques:**
    - Statistical Outlier Detection (Z-score, IQR).
    - Time-Series Validation (Cleaning gap/overlap records).
    - Automated Data Integrity Checks.

## 🎯 Results
- **60% Improvement** in data integrity through automated validation logic.
- **Efficiency:** Reduced manual data cleaning time significantly for engineers.
- **Outcome:** Successful validation of hydraulic inputs for critical infrastructure assessment.
